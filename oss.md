Since early 2018, I'm trying to help projects I'm using daily through Open Source contributions.

Here is a quick list of projects I'm contributing including my version first symfony/symfony contribution ! Should be done soon ;)
- [symfony/symfony#27770](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/27770)
- [php-cache/cache](https://github.com/php-cache/cache)
- [vlucas/phpdotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv)

In another hand, at my current company (Weglot), all the work I'm doing is also open sourced:
- [weglot/weglot-php](https://github.com/weglot/weglot-php)
- [weglot/translate-bundle](https://github.com/weglot/translate-bundle)
- [weglot/translate-laravel](https://github.com/weglot/translate-laravel)

And finally, I'm contributing to the AFUP (French Organization of PHP users) website:
- [afup/web](https://github.com/afup/web)
