Here we comes with a new playlist around the french band "La Fine Equipe" & some of their friends like Mister Modo, Ugly Mac Beer or Fakear.

Why now ? I learned recently that this band is making new records for end of 2018 ! So what a better time to listen to all thoses tracks ?

So you'll find a mix of hip-hop & samples for a quick hour ;-)
