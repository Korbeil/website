After that [April playlist](/notes/04-2018-april-discovery-playlist) I posted a week ago.
I was asking myself if I should rewind all the playlist I got in stock.

And some friend asked me too since it's easier to find playlist on the website, so I'm gonna start getting all my old playlists back there ;)
